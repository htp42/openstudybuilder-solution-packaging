    Scenario Outline: User can retrieve paginated data suppliers with sorting
        Given there are multiple data suppliers available
        When the user requests data suppliers with page_number, page_size, and sort_by
        Then the response should have a status code of 200
        And the response should include the keys "items", "total", "page", and "size"
        And the number of items in the response should be <expected_result_len>
        And the total count of data suppliers should be <total_count>
        And the current page number in the response should be <page_number>
        And the size of the page in the response should be <page_size>
        And the items in the response should be sorted by "<sort_field>" in <sort_order> order
