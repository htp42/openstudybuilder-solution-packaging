Feature: Manage ODM Study Events in Clinical MDR API
    As an API user, I want to manage ODM Study Events through the Clinical MDR API endpoints.

    Background: Test user must be able to call the Clinical MDR API, and the test data exists
        Given The test user can call the Clinical MDR API

    Scenario: User must be able to get an empty list of ODM study events
        When the user calls the API endpoint 'concepts/odms/study-events'
        Then the response must include an empty list of ODM study events
        And the response status code must be 200

    Scenario: User must be able to create a new ODM study event
        When the user sends a request to create a new ODM study event with valid data
        Then the response status code must be 201
        And the response must include the newly created ODM study event
