Feature: Manage ODM Conditions in Clinical MDR API
    As an API user, I want to manage ODM Conditions through the Clinical MDR API endpoints.
    
    Background: Test user must be able to call the Clinical MDR API, and the test data exists
        Given The test user can call the Clinical MDR API
