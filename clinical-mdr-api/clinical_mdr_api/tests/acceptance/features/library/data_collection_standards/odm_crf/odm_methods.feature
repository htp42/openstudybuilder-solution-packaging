Feature: Manage ODM Methods in Clinical MDR API
    As an API user, I want to manage ODM Methods through the Clinical MDR API endpoints.

    Background: Test user must be able to call the Clinical MDR API, and the test data exists
        Given The test user can call the Clinical MDR API

    Scenario: User must be able to get an empty list of ODM methods
        When the user calls the API endpoint 'concepts/odms/methods'
        Then the response must include an empty list of ODM methods
        And the response status code must be 200
