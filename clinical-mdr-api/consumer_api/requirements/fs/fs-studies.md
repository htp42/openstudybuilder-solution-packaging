## FS-ConsumerApi-Studies-AuditTrail-Get-010 [`URS-ConsumerApi-Studies-AuditTrail`]

Consumers must be able to retrieve study audit trail entries by calling the `GET /studies/audit-trail` endpoint.

### Request

The endpoint must accept the following query parameters:

- `from_ts` (required): Start timestamp in ISO format with timezone (e.g., 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z). Audit trail entries with timestamps greater than or equal to this value will be returned.

- `study_id` (optional): Filter by study ID using case-insensitive partial match (e.g., "NN1234-5678").
- `entity_type` (optional): Filter by entity type (e.g., "StudyActivity").
- `exclude_study_ids` (optional): List of study IDs to exclude using case-insensitive partial match.
- `page_number` (optional): Page number for pagination (default: 1).

### Response

The endpoint must return audit trail entries in CSV format with the following columns:

- `ts`: Timestamp of the action
- `study_uid`: Study UID
- `study_id`: Study ID
- `action`: Action performed (Create, Edit, Delete)
- `entity_uid`: UID of the entity affected by the action
- `entity_type`: Type (node labels) of the entity affected by the action. Multiple labels are separated by '|' character.
