# Activity Concepts

## Introduction

An ***Activity*** is by CDISC defined as an action, undertaking, or event, which is anticipated to be performed or observed, or was performed or observed, according to the study protocol during the execution of the study.

CDISC defines a ***Biomedical Concept*** as a unit of biomedical knowledge created from a unique combination of characteristics that include implementation details like variables and terminologies, used as building blocks for standardized, hierarchically structured clinical research information.

In OSB we support biomedical concepts of different types, and we see the concepts as definitions in more complex structures consisting of a set of related elements as opposed to controlled terminologies that can be represented as simpler term definitions in code lists. The term biomedical concepts has been difficult to grasp as it can cover many different things. In OSB we have therefore decided to simply name them **Concepts** as a broad term, and you can find the management of these under the menu **Library** > **Concepts**. The most important type of concept in OSB is concepts detailing activities, therefore simply named as **Activity Concepts**.

An Activity Concept in OpenStudyBuilder is made to support both the protocol specification (electronically) as well as the down-stream data flow (Forms, SDTM). An activity can be a clinical data recording (like measurement of body weight), but it can also be an activity performed during the study that is not leading to collection of data (like administration of study drug).

The OpenStudyBuilder activity concepts model consists of the following main elements each represented in tabs under the menu **Library** > **Concepts** > **Activities**:

- **Activities** are, as described in the introduction, actions, undertakings, or events that are anticipated to be performed or observed, or were performed or observed, according to the study protocol during the execution of the study. An activity related to data collection results in a semantic logical observation — meaning a formally defined, meaningful data point — which can have different identifications depending on context and qualifiers. An activity not related to data collection refers to a semantically specific activity, i.e. an activity with a precise definition but without resulting data (e.g. administration of study drug). Activities are represented at the most detailed level as needed in the protocol SoA, and are referred to in protocol section 8 and protocol appendixes.

- **Activity Groups** is high-level grouping of activities. The Activity Group can be what you decide to show in the protocol SoA. The Activity Group can be similar to CRF form names, but not necessarily. It is basically the clinical term relevant to show in the protocol both in overview section one as well as sub headings in section 8.

- **Activity Subgroups** is a second grouping level of activities similar to the Activity Groups.

- **Activity Instances** are similar to the CDISC BC SDTM specialisation, but defined semantically to an ADaM PARAM/PARAMCD specialisation.
The identification is for a specific semantic logical observation, this includes reference to context and qualifier values (like fasting plasma glucose). Primary identification is for ADaM BDS PARAM/PARAMCD, identification in occurrence datasets or column name in ADSL as well as identification in SDTM dataset. The Activity Instance can also include reference to external dictionaries (like NCI Thesaurus) and sponsor identification (like topic code). This will enable unique identification of source data, representation in SDTM by several qualifiers, and representation in ADaM BDS by PARAMCD value. The Activity Instance will always have a relationship to one Activity. The Activity Instance can have relationship to one or more Activity Instance Classes. The Activity Instance is the data collection specification of an activity to be used to link the operational SoA with data collection instruments such as CRFs and external data specifications.

> Note, coming in OSB later is support for derived Activity Instances as derivation concepts.

- **Activity Instance Classes** define the type of logical observation for an Activity Instance, and determine which Activity Item Classes (i.e. variable types) are relevant. For example, a numeric finding expects variables such as collection unit, collection value, standard unit, and value in standard unit — these are common characteristics of logical observations measuring numeric assessments. The Activity Instance Class has a recursive self-relationship describing the hierarchical relationship from general classes to more specific ones, where properties from the general ones are inherited by the sub classes (e.g. Subject Observation -> Finding -> Numeric Finding). The Activity Instance Class also has a relationship to zero or more Activity Item Classes.

- **Activity Item Classes** are the semantically defined generic types of variables related to a specific Activity Instance Class. Each Activity Item Class is related to a Semantic Item Role and a Semantic Item Data Type. Most Activity Item Classes will be related to an Activity Instance via an Activity Item. The Activity Item Class holds the relationship to Variable Class representations in various Data Models and Implementation Guides, connecting the semantic definition of a variable to its various representations in connected data models. The Activity Item Classes are typically defined based on general SDTM and ADaM model understanding, but are independent of any specific data models.

> NOTE, Each of the activity concepts main elements are individually versioned library objects in the OpenStudyBuilder repository solution. You can read more on the different versioning approaches in the user guide introduction section and other sections.

The following sections describe each of the tabs where you manage and browse the main elements of the activity concepts model. Note, within each section you have an expandable section with attribute details.

Each row in the display tables for activity concepts has hyper links into a detailed overview page for relevant column values. So e.g. a specific activity name will have a hyper link that opens a detailed overview of that specific activity, with relevant actions, different display views, and hyper links to related elements.

### Create Activity Instance

 1. Select **Library** > **Concepts** > **Activities** > **Activity Instances** tab, click the **'Add activity instance'** icon.

     [Add screen dump]: #

 1. Search and select the Activity this Activity Instance is related to including the grouping. Once selected the header info box will show the selected Activity and Activity grouping. Then click Continue.

 1. First select the Activity Instance Class (see values and related definitions in following step). For all classes the following shared attributes must be made:
     - Related data domain (will map to CDISC SDTM dataset)
     - Data category and subcategory (will map to content categories in CDISC SDTM datasets)

    [Add screen dump]: #

 1. Depending on what Activity Instance Class is selected the following selections must be made:
     - For **NumericFindings** class: 
         - Test code and test name (will map to the finding test code and test name variables in CDISC SDTM datasets). Note, this selection is a paired selection, and you have the option to use an advanced search by clicking the search icon next to the drop down controls.
         - Unit dimension (grouping of a set of units where conversions can be made between these units)
         - Standard unit for the numeric finding (this will control the unit for the standard value in the CDISC SDTM dataset)

     [Add screen dump]: #

     - For **CategoricFinding** class:
         - Test code and test name (will map to the finding test code and test name variables in CDISC SDTM datasets). Note, this selection is a paired selection, and you have the option to use an advanced search by clicking the search icon next to the drop down controls.
         -  Code list for categoric finding original result and either all terms in this code list or a selected subset of terms as the valid response terms for the categoric finding. Note here you also have the option to use an advanced search by clicking the search icon next to the term value drop down control.

     [Add screen dump]: #

     - For **TextualFindings** class:
         - Test code and test name (will map to the finding test code and test name variables in CDISC SDTM datasets). Note, this selection is a paired selection, and you have the option to use an advanced search by clicking the search icon next to the drop down controls.
         
     [Add screen dump]: #

     > Note, Other Activity Instance Classes are still to be specified.

 1. Next is for the finding classes to specify optional potential Activity Item values that will drive the identification and name for the Activity Instance:
     - Depending on the selections made on the previous step the system will suggest default values for Activity Instance name attributes, the ADaM PARAM/PARAMCD values, and the sponsor topic code identifier.
     - If additional Activity Item Classes are added where their qualifier values are part of identifying the Activity Instance then those values will also be part of the system defaulted identifier values.
         - Click the '+ Activity Item Class' control, select an Activity Item Class, and if applicable a qualifier term value. 
     - You have the option to override the system defaulted values by clicking the 'Customize' control.
     - Enter the NCI Thesaurus preferred name and code ID. NCI values have to be looked up manually as OSB does not yet support dynamic search and reference to the NCI Thesaurus.
     - For the findings classes it is possible to flag if data from the Activity Instance will come from a research lab.

     [Add screen dump]: #

 1. Last is to specify optional Activity Items that are not part of identifying the Activity Instance. These values are used to specify data that can be collected on a CRF or an external specification. Examples are methods, anatomical locations or evaluator information.
     - Click the '+ Activity Item Class' control, select an Activity Item Class, and if applicable a qualifier term value. 

 1. Click **SAVE**.

 1. Approve the new Activity Instance by clicking the **Approve** icon or via the table row 3 actions dots menu.


### Edit Activity Instance

 1. Select **Library** > **Concepts** > **Activities** > **Activity Instances** tab, search and select the row to be edited, click the 3 action dots on the row, **New version (attributes)**, then select to display **Draft** rows, select **Edit attributes** on the 3 action dots menu.

     [Add screen dump]: #

 > Note, you cannot edit the related activity for an Activity Instance. If this is needed you need to retire the Activity Instance and then create a new one for the correct activity.
 > If you need to edit the groupings, then this is done by a dedicated versioning and edit action on the row menu.

 1. Edit the Activity Instance attributes.

 > Note, the Activity Instance Class, data domain and Activity Item Classes related to the identification of PARAM/PARAMCD cannot be edited.

 1. Enter a short change description.

 1. Click **SAVE**.

 1. Approve the changes by clicking the **Approve** icon or via the table row 3 actions dots menu.
